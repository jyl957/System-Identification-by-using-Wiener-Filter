# System-Identification-by-using-Wiener-Filter

Project Name：System Identification using Wiener Filter

Project Description：System identification uses statistic methods to build mathematical models of dynamic systems from observed input-output data. It can be used to simulate in control system and predict the output of an unknown system.

Project Responsibility：The Wiener filter with different orders were built by using measured data in sequence. The mean square error(MSE) for the filter operating in the optimum regime was calculated. A curve showing dependence between MSE and the filter length was generated to trade off accuracy of the model against filter order, then the optimum one was determined.
